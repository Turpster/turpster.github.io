        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="assets/images/me.jpg" align="right" style="margin: 6px 0 0 10px; height: 180px">

        <p style="text-align: justify">My name is Reece, I am a self-taught 17 year old programmer from the UK, alone
            in my own world.<span style="color: gray"> it's kinda lonely out here.</span>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Throughout the years I have only progressed and this is what makes me excited for the future. I always
            wanted to create my own software and it all started with my Minecraft Server as a kid. And, just as a kid, I
            started to learn Java, my first programming language. It opened up a new world for me, with endless
            possibilities. It wouldn't matter if I was creating a calculator, or a lie detector, it was my magic. I
            designed this. I made this. And it spiraled my creativity. Ever since the moment I created my first
            calculator in Java, I realised that Software Engineers are not 0 and 1 stalkers, but influential artists.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            My wisdom only grew and I eventually learnt everything I needed to know with Java, it really was my
            only <i>paintbrush</i>, that is until I began to learn to use other types of <i>paintbrush</i>; HTML, C++,
            C#, Javascript along with libraries and frameworks to match, came with it. By the age of 17, I am currently
            creating a Game Engine with low level calls with open-gl using C#.

            In my spare time, I skate at the skatepark while listening to punk of course, I generally stay away from
            negative people but this city has lots of them! but I know who my real friends are...

            "This past year, I decided I wanted to start a Minecraft server network. Upon much thought and consideration,
            I decided to start with a website. I have created and made many websites on my own, but this time I decided
            I wanted to hire a professional developer. Upon further review, I contacted Turpster, who has offered me
            excellent help since."

            only has he helped me with website design and stunning themes/templates, but also, custom programs & plugins
            alongside teaching me much regarding coding and programming languages."
